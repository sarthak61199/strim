## ðŸŸ¢ EPIC 0: Project Setup (Developer Workflow)

**Goal:** As the developer, I want a fully bootstrapped monorepo with clean architecture, so I can build features quickly without worrying about setup.

[x] - **US-0.1:** I can create a Turborepo monorepo with `apps/`, `packages/`, and `infra/` folders already in place.
[x] - **US-0.2:** I have a root `package.json` with workspaces and scripts (`dev`, `build`, `lint`, `test`).
[] - **US-0.3:** I have `turbo.json` configured to build apps/packages in dependency order.
[] - **US-0.4:** I have a `server` app scaffolded with Hono/Fastify + TS and hot reload.
[] - **US-0.5:** I have a `web` app scaffolded with Next.js + Tailwind + TS.
[] - **US-0.6:** I have an optional `cli` app for admin tasks.
[] - **US-0.7:** Running `npm run dev` starts server and web together, with live reload.
[] - **US-0.8:** I have shared packages for `types`, `utils`, `config`, and `db`.
[] - **US-0.9:** I have ESLint, Prettier, Husky hooks for clean commits.
